Stikked is an Open-Source PHP Pastebin, with the aim of keeping a simple and easy to use user interface.

Stikked allows you to easily share code with anyone you wish. Stikked was created for the following reasons:

* IRC and Private Chats were spammed.
* Pastebins were ugly.
* Pastebins were confusing.
* Pastebins were messy and not thought through.
* Stikked rethought code collaboration, by making it easy to paste code.

I copied the original Stikked (http://code.google.com/p/stikked/) and fixed several bugs.

This is Version 0.6.1.
It has new features and several bugfixes:

* The language-selection was broken; the dropdown now features all the languages that GeSHi supports
* Updated to CodeIgniter version 2.1.0
* Creation of bit.ly-URLs (instead of snipurl)
* Fixed download link
* Paste downloads as a .txt file
* No need to have PHP short tags enabled
* Automatic creation of all necessary MySQL tables
* Raw-mode is now like the raw-mode on pastebin.com
* Minification and concatenation of CSS and JavaScript files (can be turned on/off)
* Breached the license by removing the nasty copyright footer

Version 0.5 featured:

* Paste Replies
* Fluid width pastes
* Auto copying paste url to clipboard.
* Paste expiration.
* Fully standards compliant css and xhtml.
* Random generating names for anonymous users
* Paste downloading

In the future you can expect the following:

* Paste embedding
